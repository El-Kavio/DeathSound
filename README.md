# DeathSound

![Datapack image](https://i.imgur.com/x5vvkHR.png)

**DeathSound** is a **datapack** that plays a **sound** to all players whenever one of them dies.<br>
There are **[8-10 sounds](. "Depends on the version you're using.")** and their **variants**, selected to add a more fearsome experience to yours and others deaths.

## How to update

Simply **delete** the **DeathSound.zip** and **replace** it with the **new** one!

## Note

Let me know if you want this datapack for versions below 1.15 by **<a href="https://github.com/El-Kavio/DeathSound/issues" target="_blank">opening an issue**
